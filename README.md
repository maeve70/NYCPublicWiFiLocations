# NYCPublicWiFiLocations

This data set came from NYC Open data. Last updated on 9.23.22

Lists all the public locations of citywide public computer centers (this is in addition to the computers at NYCPL, Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, SI Public Libraries.

My thought process for this dive into this dataset: The Mayor plans to cut the Public Libraries budget, which negatively affects communities for a number of reasons. If you cut the budgets for libraries you're taking away a community hub & resource for people. Libraries have computer workstations for people to use for a variety of reasons--learning, job search & application, etc.


**21% of NYC households don't have broadband access.**

Accorinding to data from 2021, and all this data here:

Public libraries are communal centers for many NYC neighborhoods, offering a wide range of programs including computer usage. If you cut the budget to the libraries, you're hurting communities including those most vulnerable in the communities. People need access to WiFi and computers. I wanted to look at other sites in NYC that have access to public computers, where they are located, and in what areas they fall short.
